# Concept for hosting websites inside a framework

## Getting Started

> Run each of these in a separate terminal instance so that all sites can be run concurrently:

* Navigate to `angular-example` directory and execute `ng serve`.
* Navigate to `react-example` directory and execute `npm start`.
* Navigate to `vue-example` directory and execute `npm run serve`.
* Navigate to `aspnetcore-example` directory and execute `dotnet run`.
* Open browser and serve up the `index.html` page.

This should show you a row of tabs, each with an icon indicating the site being served.
Clicking on the tab will show that particular site being rendered in the space directly below the row of tabs.

You can also checkout the JS Bin [here](https://output.jsbin.com/xitaquf), although, it will still require that the various sites above be started.
